The Odin Project - Foundation - project: create a recipe website

This is the first project in The Odin Project, Foundation online course.

Tho most of this project will be strictly what The Odin Project specifies, I plan to add a few things that are not specified.

Unspecified additives:
- Templates folder: with template files to be copied, to reduce amount of boiler plate I write.
- Extra images: image for header and footer, as practice for using and pathing to images within a directory.
- Sources: a place to link to any outside resources I used during the making of the website.
- Return links: links that point back to index.html, to make site navigation easier.
